# My App

I was teaching the Basics of Python to my students in the ATG teaching Program. See what they came up with :
Next thing will be to focus on another important skill in the teaching program. Coding is fun and hope it is become fun for my students as well.

## Description
My App is a simple Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI) application that allows users to validate personal information, manage text files, and interact with a menu-driven system. The application provides functionalities such as:
- Validating user input (Name, Age, and ID Number)
- Opening and saving text files
- A menu with different functionalities, including sending messages and identity validation.

## Features
### 1. **User Information Validation**
- Users can enter their Name, Age, and ID Number.
- The app validates the input:
  - Name should be at least 5 characters.
  - Age should be greater than 18.
  - ID Number must be exactly 8 digits.

### 2. **File Management**
- Open and read text files (.txt, .pdf, and all file types).
- Save text input to a file.
- Success messages for saved files.

### 3. **Menu System**
- **Identity Validation**: Takes users to the validation form.
- **Send Messages**: Opens a text area for writing and saving messages.
- **News from Kenya**: Placeholder for future news integration.
- **Exit App**: Closes the application.

## Installation & Setup
1. Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3.x recommended).
2. Install Tkinter (if not included in your Python version):
   ```sh
   pip install tk
   ```
3. Download the script and run it:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Launch the application.
2. Use the menu bar to navigate between features.
3. Enter details in the validation form and click **Validate**.
4. Open and save text files using the **Send Messages** feature.
5. Exit the application using the **Exit App** menu option.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter

## Future Improvements
- Add a database for storing validated user details.
- Implement a real-time news feed.
- Enhance file management with more formats (e.g., PDF reading and saving).
